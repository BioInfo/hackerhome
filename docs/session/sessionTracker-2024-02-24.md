# Session: Performance and State Management Improvements

## Overview
Fixed critical issues with state management, data loading, and component architecture to improve application stability and performance.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Management
- Consolidated state in useNewsSource hook
- Implemented in-memory caching system
- Added proper cleanup and abort controllers
- Fixed race conditions in data fetching
- Improved error handling and recovery

### 2. Hook Structure
- Fixed hook ordering in HomePage component
- Added memoization for derived states
- Implemented consistent hook dependencies
- Created shared event handlers
- Removed redundant state updates

### 3. Component Architecture
- Removed nested anchor tags
- Added proper click handling
- Improved accessibility
- Fixed TypeScript types
- Better prop passing

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- Added request cancellation
- Implemented rate limiting
- Improved cache invalidation
- Better memory management
- Reduced re-renders

## Files Modified
- src/hooks/useNewsSource.ts
- src/App.tsx
- src/components/NewsCard.tsx
- src/components/GithubCard.tsx
- src/components/sections/NewsSection.tsx

- src/api/sources/github.ts

## Technical Details

### useNewsSource Hook
- Single state object to prevent race conditions
- Memory-based caching system
- Proper cleanup on unmount
- Better error recovery
- Type-safe implementation

### Component Updates
- Consistent event handling
- Better accessibility support
- Improved type safety
- Reduced prop drilling
- Better error boundaries

### Data Loading
- Rate limiting protection
- Request cancellation
- Fallback data handling
- Better error messages
- Cache invalidation

## Testing Notes
1. Verify data loading across all sources
2. Test mode switching behavior
3. Check infinite scroll functionality
4. Validate error handling
5. Monitor performance metrics

## Next Steps
1. Add error boundaries
2. Implement performance monitoring
3. Add automated tests
4. Consider implementing service workers
5. Add analytics tracking
