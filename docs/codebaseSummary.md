# HackerHome Codebase Summary

## Architecture Overview

HackerHome is a dual-mode tech news aggregator built with React and TypeScript. The application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on performance, accessibility, and maintainable code.

### Core Components

#### Interface Modes
- Simple Mode: Clean, focused interface for essential features
- Advanced Mode: Rich features and customization options
- Seamless mode switching with persistent preferences

#### Data Management
- In-memory caching system
- Request cancellation and rate limiting
- Error recovery with fallback data
- Type-safe data handling

### Key Features

1. News Aggregation
- Multiple source integration (HackerNews, DevTo, GitHub)
- Customizable feeds and time ranges
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Infinite scroll loading

2. Performance Optimizations
- Virtual rendering for large lists
- Memoized components and callbacks
- Smart caching strategy
- Request cancellation

3. User Experience
- Responsive design
- Keyboard accessibility
- Dark mode support
- Loading states and error handling

## Key Components

### Data Fetching
- `useNewsSource`: Generic hook for data fetching and caching
- `api/sources/`: Source-specific API integrations
- Memory-based caching system

### UI Components
- `NewsCard`: Displays news items in both modes
- `GithubCard`: Repository display component
- `NewsSection`: News source section container
- `MainLayout`: Application layout wrapper

### State Management
- React's built-in state management
- Custom hooks for specific features
- Context for global state

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Consolidated state objects
- Memoized derived states
- Proper cleanup and side effects
- Type-safe implementations

### Performance
- Request cancellation
- Rate limiting protection
- Smart cache invalidation
- Memory management
- Reduced re-renders

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation
- Fallback content
- Error recovery
- User feedback

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Feature-based directory structure
