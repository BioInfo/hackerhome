# HackerHome Project Context & Next Steps

## 2025 Revamp Initiative

HackerHome is undergoing a comprehensive revamp for 2025, focusing on three core pillars:
1. Dual-Mode Interface (Simple/Advanced)
2. Performance Optimization
3. Content Enhancement

Refer to the [2025 Revamp Document](revamp-2025.md) for detailed specifications and implementation guidelines.

## Project Overview

HackerHome is a modern, responsive web application that aggregates tech news and trending information from multiple sources (Hacker News, DEV.to, GitHub). The application features real-time search, infinite scrolling, customizable news feeds, and theme support.

### Key Features
- Multi-source news aggregation
- Real-time search functionality
- Infinite scrolling with progressive loading
- Light/Dark theme support
- Responsive grid layout
- Efficient caching system

## Recent Updates (March 19, 2024)

### Performance Improvements
1. Implemented progressive loading with React Suspense
2. Added stale-while-revalidate caching pattern
   - News items: 5-minute cache
   - GitHub trending: 1-hour cache
   - Search results: 1-minute cache
3. Optimized grid layout with dynamic columns
4. Improved skeleton loading states
5. Fixed initial page loading flash

### Technical Achievements
- Reduced page load time to under 2 seconds
- Implemented efficient local storage caching
- Optimized component rendering and transitions
- Enhanced loading state visuals
