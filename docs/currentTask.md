# Current Development Task

## Current Objectives
- Implement dual-mode interface system for 2025 revamp
- Focus on Phase 4: Interface Modes Implementation (Weeks 7-8)

## Relevant Context
Links to related tasks in [Project Roadmap](projectRoadMap.md):
- Phase 4: Interface Modes Implementation
  - Simple Mode Implementation
  - Advanced Mode Implementation
  - Mode Switching System

## Technical Context
As defined in [revamp-2025.md](revamp-2025.md):

### Simple Mode Requirements
```typescript
interface SimpleMode {
  layout: 'list' | 'compact-grid';
  features: {
    essential: true;
    advanced: false;
    experimental: false;
  };
  performance: {
    priority: 'speed';
    caching: 'aggressive';
  };
}
```

### Advanced Mode Requirements
```typescript
interface AdvancedMode {
  layout: 'grid' | 'masonry' | 'custom';
  features: {
    essential: true;
    advanced: true;
    experimental: boolean;
  };
  performance: {
    priority: 'features';
    caching: 'balanced';
  };
}
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Simple Mode Implementation
- [ ] Create basic layout components
  - [ ] Implement list view
  - [ ] Implement compact grid view
- [ ] Set up essential metadata display
- [ ] Implement performance optimizations
  - [ ] Aggressive caching strategy
  - [ ] Essential-only feature loading
- [ ] Add user preferences integration

### 2. Advanced Mode Implementation
- [ ] Develop enhanced layout components
  - [ ] Grid view
  - [ ] Masonry view
  - [ ] Custom layout system
- [ ] Set up rich metadata integration
- [ ] Implement advanced interactive features
- [ ] Add community features infrastructure

### 3. Mode Switching System
- [ ] Create mode switcher component
- [ ] Implement smooth transition animations
- [ ] Set up state persistence system
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Performance Targets
- Page load < 2s
- Time to interactive < 3s
- First contentful paint < 1s
- Mode switch time < 300ms

## Notes
- Keep performance as top priority during implementation
- Ensure smooth transitions between modes
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing features
- Follow TypeScript strict mode guidelines
- Update documentation as features are implemented
